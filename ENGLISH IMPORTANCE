
										 @@@@	ENGLISH IMPORTANCE  @@@@
										 --------------------------------


						@@@@ every sentence use VERB according to SUBJECT in it @@@@
							  subject is singular/plural of tenses
							  
COMPOUND SUJECTS (A,B)
----------------

(#) Eighter A or B
	Neighter A nor B
	A or B
	
	- always use second subject for adding verb (or compound sentences)
	
Example:
 1. eighter they OR He __is__ going there 
 2. Neighter he, his parents nor I ___was___ going to perk
 3. you or I __am__ suppose to meet her today

(#)But		"A    AND   B"
		subject1 AND subject2 ===> we treat it as plural(if subjects are seprate)
							Example: time and tide __wait__ for none
							
(#) but if this type of sentence have EACH before subject1 or subject2 or both then we treat this as singular subject 
	EX: each boy and each girl ___is___ intelligert 
	
(#) exception2:
				if two things make a single item(like RAJMA and RICE) : this is treated as singular  // SIMILAR IDENTITY
				1. RAJMA and RICE ___was___ my favourate dish.
				2. BREAD and BUTTER ___is___ his daily breakfast
				3. HORSE and CARRIAGE __is__ rearly seen now.
				4. my bag and Baggage __has__ been thrown out of hotel.


(#) "THE" A AND B  ===> verbe use always singular (that mean A is also B, same person) 
						Ex:
						1. The director and Producer __is__ coming to Delhi.
						
	BUT 
		if we have the with both subject ---> "The A and The B"
	OR
		if B is plural i.e "THE A and THE B's"
	Example:
	
					Ex:
					1. The Director and The Producer __are__ coming to delhi
					or
					   The Director and __THE__ Producers __are__ coming to Delhi
					   
					2. The writer and the editor of the film __have been__ invited.
	


(#) "A   OF  B"   - always use verb as per A. i.e if A is singular the verb is Singular and vise-versa
			Example:
						A 			B
				1. The almirah of books __is__ mine.
				
				2. the list of Paneer dishes __was__ written on the page.
				
				3. A period of 3 months __is__ what I need.
				
				4. The people of my country __are__ extreanly talented.
				
				


(#) if two subjects have below connectors in a sentence, we always use VERBE with respect to first sentence
	- A, as well as B
	- A, along with B
	- together with
	- in addition to
	- with
	- not
	- and not
	
	Example : 
			1. Ravi, not Aman ___goes___ to school.   
			or we can say
			-------------
			Ravi ___goes___ to school, Not Aman.
			
			2. He, not his parents ___is___ sitting.
			
			3. I, with he, __am__ coming.
				

(#) There/Here
				always use VERB accourding to immediate after noun.
			EX:
			1. There __is__ a person in the village   	(a person - singular)
			2. There __were__ a few people in the village.  (a few - plural)
			3. Here ___is___ no one in the house.  (no one - singular)
			4. Here ___is___ is the money.  (money is singular)
			5. There __comes__ he.
			
(#) CONDITIONAL SENTENCES : ALWAYS USE "WERE"
	---------------------
		EX
		1. if I __were__ you, I woudn't go. (if the sentence start with "IF" then always use "were")
		2. __were__ I you, I woudn't go. (some time IF is missing)
		3. __were__ she not at home, how would she call you?
		4. If I __were__ a little taller, I could touch the fan myself. 
		5. If she __were__ a graduate, she cound get a great job.		
	
	EXCEPTION
	=========
		but if the sentence sence is not Subjective/hypothetical i.e it is an indicative mode
		then we use "Was"
		
		Eamplex:
			If I __was__ you, I woudn't go. ===> for the sentece when I am taking abour fact Like: if a past director says this to current director. Because he is not imagining, he is giving fact, when he was in your place he was not going there.
			so this sounds like
			when/whenever I __was__ you, I woudn't go.
	

(#) "wish" SENTENCES : always use "were" or "would be"
	----------------
		Example:
			1. I wish I __were__ a girl.        OR        I wish I __would be___ a girl.
			2. I wish it __were__ monday today.
			
			

(#) if the subject is (sum of money, duration of time,distance):- we always use SINGULAR with uncountable noun
		example:
		1. rs 1 __is__ enough to buy it.
		2. 1km  __is__ not a long distance.
		3. rs 10000/- ___is___ my monthly salary


(#) Many +  plural Noun ----->> use plural verb
	Many + a + singular noun ---> singular verb
	
		Example:
				1. Many soldiers __were__ killed in the war
		  same as
				   Many a solder __was__ killed in the war.
				   
				2. Many peoples __were__ standing there
				   Many a person __was__ standing there
				   
			    3. they __have__ visited the taj many times
				   they __has__ visited the taj many a time
				   

(#) ALL of the A 
   SOME of the A
   A lot of the A   --> in these cases, If A is singular we will use verb as singular
									If A is plural we will use verb as plural
									
					Example:
							1. ALL of the book __is__ mine
							2. ALL of the books __are__ mine
							3. ALL of it __is__ made in India
							4. ALL of these __are__ made in India

				Singular : someone/somebody, Anyone/Anybody, No one/Nobody, one, Everyone/Everybody, something, Anything, Each, Every, Other, Nothing, Everything, Little, Much, Either, Neighter, Another
				
				Plural: Both, few, Many, Several, Others
				
				singulat/Plural can be use :  All, Some, More, None, Any

						if we are considering more then one person, we use plural and vice versa
							EX: 
								1. All __are__ going there (hain)
								2. All __is__ mine (hai)
							
					i.e if all these ALL, Some, More, None and Any refer to countable noun then = verb use is plural
																			uncounrable noun = then singular verb
